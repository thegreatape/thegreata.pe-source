this short book could have been a quarter of the length and not lost much. Essentially:\n\n1. When taking notes, don't organize them in top-down categories—instead, link them to each other and allow structure to emerge organically.\n2. Rephrase research material in your own words to test your understanding, soon after reading it.\n3. Use the act of note taking and your archive of linked notes as an external brain—not for remembering facts, but for making connections between existing ideas and generating new ones.\n\nMostly pitched at students and academics, but I can see the approach here working for many classes of knowledge workers.

arguments for them convincing. Particularly, he leans on anecdotes and quotes about historical figures that come across as just-so stories and paints technology companies as a bit more mustache-twirling villains than is really going on.<br/><br/>All that said: the ideas and a great many of his suggested practices resonated very strongly with my lived experience. The message of the book is at its core about finding ways to live deliberately and leverage technology with intent, rather than letting it passively soak up your time and opportunity. I'll definitely be implementing a lot of this in my daily life. <br/>","Started On":"2019-02-05","Finished On":"2019-02-08","Book":{"Title":"Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy

Still darn good. <br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I went into <i>The Way of Kings</i> expecting great world-building from the author of <i>Mistborn</i>, and was not disappointed.  Roshar is a fascinating place and Sanderson has populated it with characters that feel human, even while acting as larger-than-life fantasy heroes. While the plot is rather slow to build and the book could use some judicious editing at more than 1200 pages, it picks up speed in the last half and has quite a payoff at the end. Looking forward to reading the next one.","Started On":"2018-06-14","Finished On":"2018-07-30","Book":{"Title":"The Way of

Newport's idea of \"deep work\"—intensive work or study done at the limits of ones cognitive abilities—hit home with me both as a deeply meaningful way to live and as something I struggle to spend enough time doing. As with most books on work habits, much of the content here is applied common sense, but there a lot of good tactical ideas on carving out space for depth in a distracted culture. After reading this, I've got a list of next actions and ideas that I'm excited to try out.<br/><br/>My only beef with the book lies in Newport's attitudes towards social media as a whole: he's curmudgeonly and at times strays into shades of old-man-yelling-at-cloud. He largely ignores the real positive efforts coming from people using networked tools and apps to share the results of their deep work. That said, his stance in the end comes out to \"make sure you're getting enough value of the tools you choose to offset their costs\", which I can be onboard with.<br/><br/>","Started On":"2016-01-07","Finished On":"2016-01-10","Book":{"Title":"Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World","Cover":[{"id":"attotbjgSVqEs22Ts","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/eb5ad7c207fbb9c42049384d22f21f58/2749e2a7/25744928._SY300_.jpg","filename":"25744928._SY300_.jpg","size":14735,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/bb428a776bb310d9705d8a484bbe004b/e8786737","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/d0e686111b0f1a889a689aa86907039d/1201d826","width":199,"height":300},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/1a8acde68c38370f88054dc244bd29b6/b2e703c0","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Authors":"Cal Newport","Readings":["rec6bJxf4nccLb9io"],"ISBN":"1455586692","ISBN13":"9781455586691","Genres":["nonfiction"],"Author Background":["by-men"],"Number of Pages":296,"Date Added":"2020-01-19"},"Rating":4,"Id":"Thu 01-07-2016 to Sun 01-10-2016","Read In Year":"2016","Page Count":[296]},{"Review":"This is a book I wish I'd read at eighteen; it probably could have saved me more than a few years of painfully figuring out the right habits to deal with anxiety-driven procrastination.

Pretty interesting to read about an approach to training for soldiers/firefighters/SWAT type folks, who've both got high fitness standards to meet for their jobs but can't afford to be fatigued and sore all the time. The book (and its companion) is well written and lays out some flexible plans that can be customized for your particular needs. <br/><br/>The programs aren't ideal for my personal goals at the moment—increasing my powerlifting numbers while keeping my conditioning a tic above embarrassing—but I can see myself gravitating towards this style of training more once I hit my longer-term size and strength goals. I'll definitely be stealing a few of the individual conditioning workouts, though.<br/><br/>Also worth noting: this isn't a program for beginners. The author apparently has another book coming out later this year for people who are starting from scratch.","Started On":"2016-03-22","Finished On":"2016-03-25","Book":{"Title":"Tactical Barbell II: Conditioning","Cover":[{"id":"attiMp8mpQOUT81GS","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/9ed43fd0fb775afeb3853dfefdeb8581/e937d0b1/26125009._SY300_.jpg","filename":"26125009._SY300_.jpg","size":9982,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/1f3d980a1a787d78c78334ea1255f7f5/a8125b78","width":23,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/558f2cb1ebc67b68e96af6ecdb5a1803/5ab0561d","width":188,"height":300},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/e0bc59f525eabaa293410f1a6f30ea01/ad9f4514","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Authors":"K.

It felt targeted at people who aren't already fairly comfortable thinking about human movement on a systematic / mechanical level. I did find myself agreeing with most of the author's central ideas: that mobility and health are more defined by the 95% of the time we spend outside the gym than our time inside it. Unfortunately, I didn't find much real guidance on integrating healthier movement patterns into daily life, and there wasn't anything in the corrective exercises that I didn't already have in my mental body-debugging toolkit.","Started On":"2016-01-21","Finished On":"2016-01-26","Book":{"Title":"Move Your DNA Restore Your Health Through Natural

Wendler's 5/3/1's is pretty popular, so I picked up a copy of this book to check it out. Note that even though this program can be adapted for beginners, the book seems to assume working knowledge of the correct form and mechanics for the lifts. If you don't know those, check out [b:Starting Strength: Basic Barbell Training|2098799|Starting Strength  Basic Barbell Training|Mark Rippetoe|http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1332738315s/2098799.jpg|2104162] for super super detailed descriptions of the exercises themselves.<br/><br/>I obviously can't comment on the efficacy of the system itself, as I'm reading this well before starting it, but I particularly liked a lot of Wendler's philosophical approach to lifting:<br/><br/>- Emphasize the big lifts—squat, deadlift, bench, overhead press. These have huge carry over to everything else you use your body for. The rest of your lifting is to support your growth in these lifts.<br/>- Lifting (and fitness in general) is a long game. Focus on what keeps you improving for years, not where you can get in the next 4 weeks.<br/>- Focus on the most bang-for-your-buck exercises and don't go overboard. <br/>- Your workouts shouldn't last more than 30-45 minutes.<br/>- Deloading is important. Rest is important.<br/>- Don't neglect your conditioning or flexibility.

What's advocated is basically classic paleo: lots of meat and whole vegetables, avoiding overly processed foods and ones that cause systemic inflammation. The plan is based on the pragmatic effects of such a diet, and as such contains advice for scaling one's macronutrient intake to one's body type and activity  intensity. For example, endurance athletes or strength athletes doing lots of high-intensity conditioning will, in fact, need a markedly higher carbohydrate intake. This seems to be a far more sensible approach to figuring out how to eat well than simply being dogmatic about trying to replicate some poorly-understood Neolithic diet; the author gets kudos for a few jabs at the often overly-zealous online paleo community.<br/><br/>A bit short for the price, but there isn't really any filler.","Started On":"2013-02-11","Finished On":"2013-02-11","Book":{"Title":"Paleo for Lifters","Cover":[{"id":"attySazH2mam1OxW6","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/77d767f448e66d973c6c720b03aa5f6b/7c0c2fa3/17355719._SX300_.jpg","filename":"17355719._SX300_.jpg","size":30887,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/88453daff5d07bfb2d6478d9c44bec21/bab9ca84","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/d349f8cf9c7a5ae0094913969831e5a9/1ccbd041","width":300,"height":388},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0d66bdd851e939a49276b2da79bd1d58/a05f79f2","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Authors":"Justin Lascek","Readings":["recV4E1svo8snJJzm"],"Author Background":["by-men"],"Number of Pages":60,"Date Added":"2020-01-19"},"Rating":4,"Id":"Mon 02-11-2013 to Mon 02-11-2013","Read In Year":"2013","Page Count":[60]},{"Started On":"2013-08-15","Finished On":"2013-08-19","Book":{"Title":"Kill City Blues","Cover":[{"id":"attXVQYIjaHDv87rC","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/060908a9f186ae4fd551f808fe448942/4aa7fdd1/15783828._SX300_.jpg","filename":"15783828._SX300_.jpg","size":30747,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/7b9f3ce80d300c81f138a4d14b45be67/eb31721a","width":25,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/a6980b1ebcc8c8b9eaa457a75c7df6c4/4189a51d","width":300,"height":431},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/931f1f60efb790af2460bb8b9dc66d37/27e34ac6","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Authors":"Richard Kadrey","Series":"Sandman Slim","Series Number":5,"Readings":["recVC33LnnUXbD8iX"],"ISBN":"0062094599","ISBN13":"9780062094599","Genres":["fantasy"],"Author Background":["by-men"],"Number of Pages":383,"Date Added":"2020-01-19"},"Rating":4,"Id":"Thu 08-15-2013 to Mon 08-19-2013","Read In Year":"2013","Page Count":[383]},{"Review":"Though it spends a bit too much time tooting its own horn and has some low-value filler about nutrition and general fitness, this book has some solid ideas on core training and movement quality as a remedy for back pain. There's a simple 6-week program that introduces you to the Foundation exercises. I tried the first workout today, and while giving a great posterior chain stretch, it was mild enough that I don't think I'll have trouble integrating with the rest of my weight training and mobility work. There's also a quite reasonable introductory anatomy section for the muscles of the core, and the author gets points for recommending foam rolling and compound resistance movements.<br/><br/>Note that the rating here is for the quality of the writing and material, not its efficacy; I haven't had a chance to evaluate that.  Anecdotally: having beaten down some back / sciatic nerve issues of my own in the past with kettlebell training that emphasizes strengthening the hip-hinge movement the author uses as the basis for his exercises, I'm inclined to say there's potential here.","Started On":"2013-01-28","Finished On":"2013-02-17","Book":{"Title":"Foundation: Redefine Your Core, Conquer Back Pain, and Move with Confidence","Cover":[{"id":"attoCgWDDbqfW5kcJ","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/9628e0d26c2f017d3383f902879fc753/16c9a1f1/10419529._SX300_.jpg","filename":"10419529._SX300_.jpg","size":18453,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/7997e2c5a4bac1ea7015c08344be0c3d/e75dee50","width":30,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/7bee25a7a34059723fde41f49499078b/fb8a63ed","width":300,"height":364},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/63d8f9e18ebd4b5ccf9849b1918d1807/23d21a7d","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Authors":"Eric  Goodman, Peter Park, Lance Armstrong","Readings":["recXKHL8dMTvK4gpC"],"ISBN":"1609611004","ISBN13":"9781609611002","Author Background":["by-men"],"Number of Pages":288,"Date Added":"2020-01-19"},"Rating":4,"Id":"Mon 01-28-2013 to Sun 02-17-2013","Read In Year":"2013","Page Count":[288]},{"Review":"Started off slow enough enough that I almost put it down around 100 pages or so, but picked up admirably shortly thereafter.

I had a hard time caring about any of the characters— the villain's psychosis was just over the top and Agent Cormac, the ostensible protagonist, was strangely passive through most of the story.  Asher's Polity universe has some promise, but flat characters and somewhat mushy prose kinda doomed this one for me. This was the author's first book, so perhaps I'll give one of his later novels a try another time.","Started On":"2013-05-16","Finished On":"2013-05-24","Book":{"Title":"Gridlinked (Agent Cormac #1, Polity Universe #3)","Cover":[{"id":"attQ8DwCmkCtDsJaO","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/db570a92afe0ff32a31c04dedb20ac3a/7842ab20/98046._SY300_.jpg","filename":"98046._SY300_.jpg","size":17464,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/4fb6d9654c61130dbedf74a6488050f5/093ea9b0","width":22,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/30becd9c63f70f26b63a7ed92527da39/1ed62aea","width":184,"height":300},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/37283fb87a05176c2b26e3e16f4c59cd/ff8389c6","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Authors":"Neal Asher","Readings":["recr51NDHjheK77Y2"],"ISBN":"0765349051","ISBN13":"9780765349057","Genres":["sci-fi"],"Author Background":["by-men"],"Number of Pages":423,"Date Added":"2020-01-19"},"Rating":2,"Id":"Thu 05-16-2013 to Fri 05-24-2013","Read In Year":"2013","Page Count":[423]},{"Started On":"2013-08-12","Finished On":"2013-08-15","Book":{"Title":"Fated","Cover":[{"id":"att7WAtE9NRrh3s0b","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/b3f056454896d4df6d31530b3ca6f87b/4dd84af4/11737387._SY300_.jpg","filename":"11737387._SY300_.jpg","size":19498,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/5138c5fa6cc13589999b4c586c9b62e1/8e0959ae","width":22,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/93dfccd021e859f27f5d1bedcc547bb7/052a0313","width":186,"height":300},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c766e3d5da49cb92660218279741fc23/56af79cb","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Authors":"Benedict Jacka","Series":"Alex Verus","Series Number":1,"Readings":["rectRawHdnTGR81ZM"],"ISBN":"1937007294","ISBN13":"9781937007294","Genres":["fantasy"],"Author Background":["by-men"],"Number of Pages":295,"Date Added":"2020-01-19"},"Rating":3,"Id":"Mon 08-12-2013 to Thu 08-15-2013","Read In Year":"2013","Page Count":[295]},{"Review":"Most unsettling book I've read this year.","Started On":"2013-09-23","Finished On":"2013-09-28","Book":{"Title":"Blindsight","Cover":[{"id":"attlOoz0sXIf93F5f","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/64ca4613b741f223a7062f75aa16e92f/ce2538fb/48484._SX300_.jpg","filename":"48484._SX300_.jpg","size":18357,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/05e45ae8c7d72163b61ee69f28629538/76af19c3","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/2afbd07373fcbce564539f7961b91dc1/1ddaea1c","width":300,"height":450},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/276dcd318ceb74efaa403d4715c8bebb/e6c72660","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Authors":"Peter Watts","Series":"Firefall","Series Number":1,"Readings":["recvInURHDWWCbMzX"],"ISBN":"0765312182","ISBN13":"9780765312181","Genres":["sci-fi"],"Author Background":["by-men"],"Number of Pages":384,"Date Added":"2020-01-19"},"Rating":5,"Id":"Mon 09-23-2013 to Sat 09-28-2013","Read In Year":"2013","Page Count":[384]},{"Started On":"2013-07-13","Finished On":"2013-07-17","Book":{"Title":"Throne of the Crescent Moon","Cover":[{"id":"attm6TcKJrL9CCqI0","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/8e76c601956239f816377dbea39ac03b/7b926f9e/11487807._SY300_.jpg","filename":"11487807._SY300_.jpg","size":19162,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/a8e9617d9bdb0d2bd95a9890953f1cd7/47ed21b3","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/73fbbc941858d2e61fe516adba6a5ee5/d917333c","width":199,"height":300},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/7d94f13001903e87379ce3738f71d40b/38fb8534","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Authors":"Saladin Ahmed","Series":"The Crescent Moon Kingdoms","Series Number":1,"Readings":["recvQeGmOMu4geTrs"],"ISBN":"0756407117","ISBN13":"9780756407117","Genres":["fantasy"],"Author Background":["by-men"],"Number of Pages":274,"Date Added":"2020-01-19"},"Rating":3,"Id":"Sat 07-13-2013 to Wed 07-17-2013","Read In Year":"2013","Page Count":[274]},{"Review":"Fundamentally, this book is an organization and systemization of the material that Kelly Starrett has posted on MobilityWOD.com. It covers his axioms of human movement, applies those axioms to teaching correct form on fundamental strength exercises, and provides a set of techniques to address mobility issues preventing you from moving correctly. There's a lot more here than just a bunch of 'stretching exercises'- it's really treating the human body as a complete system and provides a manual for basic maintenance.<br/><br/>I can say from years of experience that this stuff works. Without hyperbole, Starrett's techniques have been life-changing for me; I can walk to work without pain shooting down my leg and squat below parallel with good form. I've always recommended his work to people struggling with pain and stiffness, but it's pretty daunting to have to slog through two and a half years of videos to get the whole picture.

The structure is reminiscent of Jim Wendler's 5/3/1, but with higher volume and somwhat less maximal weight work, over a 16-week meta-cycle instead of a repeated 4-week structure. I like the idea of regulating the weights you use based on your performance rather than adding weight each cycle until you have to reset, but I'm unsure how I'd work in practice. There's also a good bit of information of different types of conditioning. I don't think I'll be ditching 5/3/1 anytime soon, but there's some decent food for thought here.<br/><br/>The quality of the writing is unfortunately what you'd expect from a self-published ebook from a non-profressional writer. The ideas and material are there, but it's poorly organized and is rife with grammatical mistakes and typos. It's also fairly overpriced, especially given the lack of editorial care.","Finished On":"2013-06-04","Book":{"Title":"The Juggernaut Method 2.0","Cover":[{"id":"attTTiR1t4Wigbxio","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/8699eebb180eb97ee3da15909d96af18/e8f2f0eb/18040202._SX300_.jpg","filename":"18040202._SX300_.jpg","size":10871,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/a0c7d592e89c68866c0c43084d410ae3/821c24ca","width":28,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/760c8410d72952900302fe5de0232026/fd162c36","width":300,"height":388},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/40aae19f65e383332920a1f3dd77167a/3787f776","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Authors":"Chad Wesley Smith","Readings":["recx0bYhBMy8vNEGc"],"Genres":["fitness"],"Author Background":["by-men"],"Number of Pages":120,"Date Added":"2020-01-19"},"Id":"Missing Start Date to Tue 06-04-2013","Read In Year":"2013","Page Count":[120]},{"Review":"Short, but solid introduction to being productive with tmux.

Don't expect to become more than conversant with the ideas in a particular language after reading about it here, though- three days a pop doesn't get you the ability to Get Stuff Done. Instead, you'll get the most out of this book if you treat it one or both of two ways:<br/><br/>1) A buffet of samples: try a bit of each language and see if any intrigue you enough to dive in further.

over 250 pages, crammed full of business jargon and laid out with prose that's dry as a bone.  There are a couple good nuggets in here: the critiques of Scrum's failings are pretty apt, and the notion of limiting the amount of work in progress at a given moment seems useful. But most of the book's recommendations are laid out in as abstract end-states, with little attention paid to how to get an organization of predictably irrational humans to adopt these notions, and even littler instruction given on the day-to-day implementation of said ideas.","Started On":"2012-07-04","Finished On":"2012-07-06","Book":{"Title":"Lean-Agile Software Development: Achieving Enterprise Agility","Cover":[{"id":"attQzobxVmtN4k4iQ","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f44f205521d17207074c75cdc23b12ae/08476610/6229886._SX300_.jpg","filename":"6229886._SX300_.jpg","size":36313,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/eb4420977e92a49e67f61d787ea46795/177f2ec8","width":27,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/fbb8ff9c5ada5188e52b51e86e30fd23/ab66cc9e","width":296,"height":400},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/599b0857ad9b5c70f2b7d8297f020d69/745e4d48","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"Authors":"Alan Shalloway, Guy Beaver, James R.
