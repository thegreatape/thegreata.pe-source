title: Relaunching Literate Minuteman
---

Today, I’m relaunching an old project of mine with a new coat of paint and a bunch of new goodies: [Literate Minuteman](http://literate-minuteman.com) shows you what books from your [Goodreads](http://goodreads.com) lists are available at your local Boston-area library.

## What’s new?

* Revamped visual design, with some judicious responsiveness so it works well on mobile-sized screens.
* Live loading of your books when you sign up (via Pusher).
* Tons of bug fixes and internal refactoring to bring the code from “embarassing first Rails project” to “I might not hate this in a month”.

## What’s next?

Ain’t no rest for the wicked, so what’s planned next:

* Integration with the BPL and Minuteman ebook systems.
* Email notifications when books become available.
* Filtering by individual locations and making filters persistent across browser sessions.
* Smarter queuing of book lookups for new users; right now, if two people sign up at the same time, one has to wait in line.

## Go try it!

If you live around Boston and like to read, [give it a whirl](http://literate-minuteman.com). Let me know what you think, dear reader: you can reach me at Thomas.Mayfield@gmail.com.
